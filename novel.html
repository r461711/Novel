Chapter 1: Memories of a Pill God

“Who am I? I am… Long Chen!”

“I look down on the very heavens, the arrogant Nine Firmaments’ peerless Pill God - Long Chen? … I am someone who is cheated and bullied by everyone, a spineless good-for-nothing incapable of cultivating - Long Chen?”

His mind was filled with confusion, and at the same time severe pain came from all over his body . Long Chen was unable to stop his mind’s chaotic thoughts and emitted a pained groan .

“Chen-er, you’ve finally awakened? Thank god, your mom was worried sick for you! If you want to brag about how strong you are then fine, but why did you have to go duel with those people!?”

A kind and gentle voice sounded beside Long Chen’s ear . The voice was full of happiness and comfort, but towards the end it also became choked with emotion .

Long Chen slowly opened his eyes . His blurry vision gradually became clearer, and a woman’s face appeared before him .

The woman appeared to be in her thirties and she was extremely beautiful . However, in the corner of her eyes were some deep wrinkles that did not match up with her young age .

Currently this woman was tearfully looking at Long Chen with eyes that were full of love, making Long Chen’s heart feel a burst of warmth .

“Child, you scared your mom to death . ” As the woman spoke her eyes became even redder and her tears streamed down .

“Mom???”

Long Chen looked at this familiar yet strange face . He doubtingly said this one word, his face filled with confusion .

“Child, don’t scare your mom! Don’t you recognize me?” The woman’s face immediately became panicked .

At this moment, an elderly man appeared beside the woman . He examined Long Chen he said, “Mrs . Long, Long Chen suffered a blow to the back of his head so it’s possible he will need to rest a bit to recover his memories . Don’t be too worried; just now I gave the young master some medicine . The medicinal effects still haven’t completely dissolved, so just let the young master rest for a bit longer . ”

Mrs . Long looked worriedly at Long Chen . Reluctantly she nodded her head and she followed the elderly man out of the room .

Long Chen heard the elderly man in the distance softly advising the woman, “Mrs . Long, the fact that young master Long managed to return with his life is already infinitely lucky . Don’t force it too much . ”

Mrs . Long tremblingly replied, “Master alchemist’s meaning is that my son will… . ”

The elderly man who had been called an alchemist sighed, “The young lord’s hindbrain received an acute shock . To tell the truth, being able to wake up is already extremely lucky; however the repercussions will definitely still be very severe . Losing his memory is quite possible in this situation… . ”

The two people gradually walked further and further away so Long Chen could no longer hear it clearly . . . but what was barely audible to him was the sound of Mrs . Long’s sobbing .

Long Chen gazed blankly at the ceiling above as he felt the severe pains throughout his body, especially at the back of his head which was bursting with a swollen aching pain .

Just what happened? I’m Long Chen, and so Mrs . Long is my flesh and blood mother . How could I have such an unfamiliar feeling?

And all these confusing memories, where did they come from? I have memories that I’m an arrogant, exceedingly powerful person… but at the same time I remember that I’m an often bullied and extorted bitter trash?

Pill God Long Chen? Trash Long Chen? Which is the real me? Am I the Pill God’s reincarnation? Or am I a fusion of the Pill God’s spirit with a trash weakling?

Long Chen’s mind was full of endless questions . “Whatever, it doesn’t matter . I am Long Chen . If I’m the Pill God then or not doesn’t mean anything right now; the most important thing is that I’m still alive . ”

“I have two sets of memories that have mixed together; how would I even try to fix this kind of insane problem? Instead, what I need to do now is let myself recover as quickly as possible . ”

Sensing his body’s current condition, he quickly located many fractures . He had three broken ribs, one arm broken in two places, and most severe of all, his hindbrain was injured to the point where a large portion of his scalp had caved in . He had definitely been victim to an extremely vicious assault .

“Huh, although I have no way to condense energy, my Spiritual Strength appears to be extremely powerful . I can actually sense everything within thirty meters of my body . ”

Long Chen was pleasantly surprised . According to his garbled memories, Spiritual Strength was extremely invaluable, and it was especially the most important thing to Pill Cultivators!

Profit, profit! Whether he was the reincarnation of the Pill God or just a mix containing the Pill God’s memories, the present him had definitely greatly profited .

The previous him had lived a whole lifetime as a Pill God, and now that allowed the current him to possess an exceptionally strong spirit; just what kind of awesomeness was this?

However, when he carefully examined his body, his expression changed . “My Spiritual Root has been taken away . My abdemon’s Spirit Bone is also missing a piece that appears to be dug out . And my heart has a hole? Just who would be this ruthless and take my Spirit Root, Spirit Bone and Spirit Blood? No wonder I can’t cultivate . ” Long Chen was completely infuriated .

The current him’s Spiritual Strength was exceptionally strong, even to the point where just a quick glance allowed him to solve the mystery of why the current him was a completely useless cripple .

The Spirit Root was located in the Dantian’s energy source; it was a cultivator’s foundation . Without the Spirit Root, there was no way to sense heaven and earth’s spiritual energy, let alone absorb it for cultivating .

Spirit Blood was something that people were born with; it was a trace of Xiantian blood . While basically all people were born with it, the majority of cultivators didn’t know anything about it .

The Spirit Bone was found in the pit of a person’s abdomen and slightly bulged out . Ordinary people wouldn’t have a Spirit Bone . Even amongst cultivators, maybe only one in ten thousand might have it, which marked them as a genius .

However, Long Chen Spirit Bone’s location was obviously missing a piece which had clear marks of being dug out by some person .

His face became exceedingly unsightly . If his memories were not all mixed up then how could he not remember just who had done this to his body?

Although these three things were precious, they wouldn’t have any use once they left the owner’s body . If they wanted to harm him, then why did they have to use such a harsh method? Using this kind of method was practically causing him to live a life worse than death .

However, anger only brought on more anger, and since he was already missing them, being angry did not have any use .

You better not let me find out who did this .

Long Chen couldn’t help but to gnash his teeth in anger . This was an extremely great blow to him . With him possessing a Spirit Bone, even if he was an idiot, he would still have been an absolute genius .

But now some despicable bastard had caused him to become a useless person who was incapable of cultivating, causing him to be humiliated and receive condescending looks from practically everyone .

Just when Long Chen was about to be unable to hold back his anger, the room’s door was gently pushed open, and a pretty thirteen-year-old maiden walked in . This was Long Chen’s maid who was called Bao-er .

“Young lord, it’s time to take some more medicine . ”

“Medicine? What medicine is it?” Long Chen nose moved slightly as he asked .

“This is something Mrs . Long paid an enormous price for . It’s a Tiger Bone Pill that can quickly heal the young lord’s injuries . ” Bao-er replied .

She opened the elaborate small case in her hand, revealing the medicinal pill inside . “It is said this medicinal pill came from Pill Master Yun Qi . The medicinal strength is very strong . ”

Looking at the thing, Long Chen’s face became a bit strange . Even this kind plaything could be called a pill? Its shape was extremely uneven and seemed more like a meatball .

Even not talking about the shape, its color was completely black and there wasn’t even a trace of lustre . If it wasn’t emitting a very faint medicinal aroma, then Long Chen might even suspect it was a ball of sheep dung .

After staring at the thing in his hand for a long time, Long Chen finally sighed . Someone who had lost over eighty percent of the medicinal pill’s essence could still be called a master? Long Chen bewilderedly wondered how someone had managed to create something that could become so soft and mushy .

Pills could be divided into five grades: low grade, middle grade, high grade, top grade, and peerless grade . As for the pill in his hand, it couldn’t even count as one of the five grades . Long Chen suddenly realized that this was just a defective good . It was a trash pill . Normally Pill Masters would definitely not sell these kinds of medicinal pills since they couldn’t afford to lose their customers . Oftentimes they would be turned into medicinal liquids or just directly thrown out .

“Young lord, don’t daydream . In order to obtain this precious pill, Mrs . Long already sold off her own precious jewellery . You should hurry and take it,” urged Bao-er .

Long Chen couldn’t help but to feel some pain in his heart . His impression of his mother was that she loved him very dearly to the point where it was like drowning in love and pampering . It reached the point where his mother would basically never refuse any of his requests .

His mother had done everything and anything for him . She had given birth to him while she was still young . She had grown up innately beautiful, but now she was barely thirty something years old and already had wrinkles in the corner of her eyes . Seeing those deep wrinkles, Long Chen knew that she had already sacrificed far too much for him .

Looking at the medicinal ball in his hand, he observed that although it was a defective good, the medicinal ingredients were still not bad . Although impurities took up over eighty percent of it, it wouldn’t have any problems healing his injuries .

Taking the ball of medicine, Long Chen ordered Bao-er to not leak any news of him out, excluding his mother of course .

Although Bao-er didn’t really understand, she still trusted Long Chen and obediently nodded .

After taking the medicine, although Long Chen had no way to use cultivation to absorb the medicinal strength, he managed to guide the medicinal energy to his wounds by using his formidable Spiritual Strength, making his speed of recovery extremely quick .

The second day, Long Chen slowly opened his eyes and he had a smile plastered on his mouth as he exercised his muscles .

Excellent! Although that medicine was pretty bad, medicinal ingredients themselves were of a high quality . Other than my hindbrain, the majority of my injuries have already healed, and the amount of energy left is more than enough to heal completely .

He slowly walked towards the mirror . Looking at his reflection, he saw a nothing-out-of-the-ordinary handsome youngster with eyebrows like swords and bright eyes . Long Chen took a deep breath, “From today onwards, I, Long Chen, will no longer be the previous Long Chen . I will rise above others . ”

Although his body was still slightly weak, walking was no longer a problem . Long Chen left the room and saw that the sun had already risen from the east .

After pondering deeply for an hour, he called over Bao-er and gave her a list of medicinal ingredients for her to find .

However, Bao-er’s expression became a bit embarrassed . Long Chen wondered what it was before quickly realizing that the current Long family was extremely hard pressed for money, and Bao-er had no method to get a loan .

Otherwise his mother would not have had to sell off her own jewellery, a part of her exceptionally precious dowry . The present Long family had already fallen into extremely dire straits .

Feeling around in his pocket, he found that he had just over eighty silver coins . Although this wasn’t a lot, it was enough to buy those medicinal ingredients .

Bao-er worked diligently, and not even two hours later she had managed to buy the medicinal ingredients and returned home . Long Chen immediately set about to dividing and measuring them into different portions before boiling them in a large bowl .

Six hours later, a very thick medicinal liquid was releasing a medicinal aroma . When Long Chen saw the bowl with the cheap medicinal liquid, a smile appeared on his mouth .

“I, Long Chen, will rise above others, starting from this one bowl of medicinal liquid . ”
